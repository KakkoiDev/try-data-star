# Try Data-Star Project Rules

## Project Philosophy
- Simplicity over complexity (simpli.city principle)
- Use standard web technologies when possible
- Minimize dependencies
- Server-render first, enhance with client functionality as needed

## Component Patterns
- Root-level folders represent main components/modules
- Web Components should be used for UI encapsulation
- Balance Shadow DOM (for encapsulation) and Light DOM (for props and styling) based on component needs
- Server-rendered components may need special handling for Data-Star features

## Technology Usage
- BunJS for server runtime and package management
- Data-Star for both server and client functionality
- Web Components for UI components
- Standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Code Conventions
- Use Biome for formatting and linting
- Follow Sonar Qube recommendations for code quality
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Prefer server rendering when possible

## DOM Strategy
- Consider component requirements when choosing Shadow vs Light DOM:
  - Shadow DOM: When encapsulation is primary concern
  - Light DOM: When server props and external styling are needed
  - Hybrid approaches may be explored

## Server-Client Relationship
- Server should handle as much logic as possible
- Client-side code should focus on UI interactions
- Minimize state management on the client
- Use Data-Star features like @get for necessary client-server interaction

## Testing Approach
- Unit tests for component functionality
- Integration tests for component interactions
- End-to-end tests with Playwright for user flows

## Project Structure
- Components at root level
- Clear separation of concerns
- Logical organization by feature/function

## Development Workflow
- Implement core functionality first
- Add tests once patterns are established
- Document decisions and patterns
- Refine based on practical usage

## Web Search Guidelines
- Proactively use web_search for:
  - Project dependencies and libraries information
  - Best practices for technologies (BunJS, Web Components, Data-Star)
  - Specific technical challenges identified in the Memory Bank
  - Standards and conventions for frameworks used in the project
- Respond to time-related questions using web_search
- Prioritize using web_search for factual or current information
- Document important external resources in techContext.md
