# Progress Tracker: Try Data-Star

## Project Status: Early Development

The project is in its early stages, with initial components and architecture being established. We're focusing on proving core concepts before expanding functionality.

## What Works

### Server Infrastructure
- ✅ BunJS server setup
- ✅ Basic routing
- ✅ Server-sent events (ServerSentEventGenerator)
- ✅ SQLite database integration

### Components
- ✅ Initial navbar component
- ✅ Basic dashboard structure
- ✅ Component rendering from server
- ✅ Hybrid DOM approach in main component

### Development Environment
- ✅ Zero-build approach philosophy established

## In Progress

### Main Component
- 🔄 Server-side rendering with props
- 🔄 Integrating Data-Star features (@get)
- 🔄 DOM strategy (moving toward Light DOM preference)
- 🔄 Component styling approach

### Navigation System
- 🔄 Component switching in main area
- 🔄 Navigation state management
- 🔄 Route handling improvements

### Development Environment
- 🔄 TypeScript integration via type annotation stripping (primary approach)
- 🔄 Investigating Bun's capabilities for handling TypeScript
- 🔄 Zero-build workflow implementation

## Not Started

### Testing
- ❌ Unit tests with Jest
- ❌ Integration tests with Jest
- ❌ End-to-end tests with Playwright
- ❌ Performance testing with K6

### Additional Features
- ❌ Form components
- ❌ Data tables
- ❌ Authentication system
- ❌ Dashboard widgets
- ❌ Complex data flows
- ❌ Advanced SQLite data access patterns

### Documentation
- ❌ Component API docs
- ❌ Usage examples
- ❌ Best practices guide

## Known Issues

### Technical Challenges
1. **DOM Strategy**: Need to finalize approach with Light DOM preference while solving prop handling
2. **TypeScript Integration**: Need to determine if Bun can strip type annotations at runtime (preferred) before considering transpilation options
3. **Component Communication**: Establishing patterns for component interaction
4. **CSS Strategy**: Need consistent styling approach across components

### UX/UI
1. Styling system needs to be established
2. Component transitions are not yet implemented

## Next Milestone: Functional Dashboard

The next milestone is to complete a functional dashboard with:
1. Working navbar navigation
2. Main component with Data-Star features
3. Proper props handling
4. Basic styling
5. SQLite data integration
6. TypeScript support via annotation stripping (if feasible)

This will validate the core architecture before expanding to more complex features.
